Follow [@cogmasterstats](https://twitter.com/cogmasterstats) to stay current with the latest news.\r\n\r\n**Time and place:** ENS 45, rue d'Ulm, Salle Beckett; 9:00–11:30, every Tuesday (starting October 8th.)\r\n\r\nYou should bring your personal laptop for all sessions. Internet is available on demand, but you won't need it to follow the course. It is recommended to check-out the [project page](https://github.com/cogmaster-stats/), or update your own Git repository, each week. If you want to check R data files individually, please visit the [slides](https://github.com/cogmaster-stats/r-cogstats/tree/master/slides) or [labs](https://github.com/cogmaster-stats/r-cogstats/tree/master/labs) directories.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Lectures\r\n\r\nThe R statistical software will be used during the first six courses. The [Setup](#setup) section contains additional information to install R and RStudio. The following open-access textbook will be used along the course.\r\n\r\n> Diez, DM, Barr, CD, and Çetinkaya-Rundel, M (2012).

If they are not installed on your\r\nsystem, please follow these instructions:\r\n\r\n1. Go to <http://cran.r-project.org/bin/> and select a binary package for\r\n   your system. \r\n2. Go to <http://www.rstudio.com/ide/download> and download RStudio\r\n   Desktop. There is often a\r\n   [Preview Release](http://www.rstudio.com/ide/download/preview) that\r\n   include additional functionalities but is still considered in beta\r\n   stage. \r\n\r\nInstall both software as is usually done on your system. At this point, you\r\nmay want to test that everything is ok: Launch RStudio and check that the R\r\nprompt is available in the *Console* panel (it is usually sitting on the\r\nright). You can further check that R is working as expected by typing\r\n(without the prompt sign, `>`)\r\n\r\n    > 1/3 == 0.3\r\n\r\nat the R prompt. Don't worry if the result (`FALSE`) doesn't match your\r\nexpectation, we will learn why later.\r\n\r\nYou can customize RStudio layout under File ▹ Preferences. At some point, we will make use of the\r\n[R Markdown](http://www.rstudio.com/ide/docs/authoring/using_markdown)\r\nlanguage to document our working sessions. You don't need to install\r\nanything other than RStudio, but you may want to install\r\n[Pandoc](http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/), which is a tool for converting\r\namong markup formats and generate HTML or PDF documents based on a Markdown\r\nfile. As an alternative to RStudio built-in facilities, you can install an\r\nenhanced Markdwon processor:\r\n[MultiMarkdown](http://fletcherpenney.net/multimarkdown/). \r\n\r\n### Pick up a good editor\r\n\r\nSometimes, it is easier to work directly from a text editor. There are\r\nseveral good editors available for free and working on all platforms\r\n(Windows, Un*x, and OS X), including these ones:\r\n\r\n* [Emacs](http://www.gnu.org/s/emacs/); the\r\n  [ESS mode](http://ess.r-project.org/) provides everything you need to\r\n  interact with R.\r\n* [Vim](http://vim.org/); the\r\n  [Vim-R-plugin](http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=2628)\r\n  offers allows communicating with an R process directly.\r\n* [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com/2) 2 or 3 (free for evaluation purpose,\r\n  $70 for continued use); syntax highlighting for R is already available,\r\n  and the [SublimeREPL](http://sublimerepl.readthedocs.org/en/latest/)\r\n  package also allows communicating with an R process.\r\n\r\n### Git\r\n\r\nIf you want to experiment with [Git](http://git-scm.com/) and if it is not already installed on your system, go\r\ndownload the latest version of Git. When installation is completed, check\r\nthat it is available on your system by typing (again, without the prompt\r\nsign, `$`)\r\n\r\n    $ git --version\r\n\r\nin a Terminal. Windows users may have to use a specific GUI.\r\n\r\nYou can request an [educational account](https://github.com/edu) on\r\nGithub. This will allow you to create private repositories that you can use\r\nfor your course work. Or you can create an account on\r\n[BitBucket](https://bitbucket.org/), which offers unlimited private\r\nrepositories for personal use.\r\n\r\nIn any case, you can follow the course and download the latest archive of\r\nthe course on [Github](https://github.com/cogmaster-stats).\r\n\r\n\r\n### Useful readings\r\n\r\n* Kieran Healy\r\n  (2010).
