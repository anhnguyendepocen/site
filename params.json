{"name":"Cogmaster-stats","tagline":"Companion website for the cogmaster-stats workshop","body":"## Welcome to the cogmaster-stats class\r\n\r\nGeneral annoucements about this class will be made on Twitter. Follow [@cogmasterstats](https://twitter.com/cogmasterstats) to stay current with the latest news.\r\n\r\n**Time and place:** ENS 45, rue d'Ulm, Salle Weil; 9:00–11:00, every Tuesday (starting October 7th.); [calendar](http://aliquote.org/cours/cogmaster-stats/cogmaster-stats.ics) (ICAL format, subjected to changes)\r\n\r\nYou should bring your personal laptop for all sessions. Internet is available on demand, but you won't need it to follow the course. It is recommended to check-out the [project page](https://github.com/cogmaster-stats/), or update your own Git repository, each week. If you want to check R data files individually, please visit the [slides](https://github.com/cogmaster-stats/r-cogstats/tree/master/slides) or [labs](https://github.com/cogmaster-stats/r-cogstats/tree/master/labs) directories. Data sets are available in the [data](https://github.com/cogmaster-stats/r-cogstats/tree/master/data) directory, or directly as a [ZIP file](http://aliquote.org/cours/cogmaster-stats/data.zip).\r\n\r\nTo compile slides at home, you will need this custom [CSS file](http://aliquote.org/cours/cogmaster-stats/style.css), although some pictures will be missing in the final output. The slides are based on [ioslides](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/ioslides_presentation_format.html). There are some keyboard shortcuts available: 'f' enable fullscreen mode; 'w' toggle widescreen mode; 'o' enable overview mode. For better rendering, it is recommended to toggle at least the widescreen mode. You can navigate throughout the slideshow using the arrow keys (left/right) on your keyboard.\r\n\r\n\r\n## R lectures\r\n\r\nThe R statistical software will be used during the first seven courses. The [Setup](#setup) section contains additional information to install R and RStudio. The following open-access textbook will be used along the course.\r\n\r\n> Diez, DM, Barr, CD, and Çetinkaya-Rundel, M (2012). [OpenIntro Statistics](http://www.openintro.org/stat/) (2nd edition).\r\n\r\nOther resources are provided at the bottom of this page; see [Textbooks](#textbooks) and [Online resources to learn R](#online).

The report should be preferably written in Markdown/reST with R or Python code, and submitted by email before the deadline. Custom templates are available for [R/Markdown](https://github.com/cogmaster-stats/r-cogstats/blob/master/projects/template.Rmd) and [Python/Pweave](https://github.com/cogmaster-stats/r-cogstats/blob/master/projects/template.Pnw). \r\n\r\nThe *project can be done with one or two other colleagues* (not more). The same mark will be given to all students from the same group. \r\n\r\n**Due date is 2013/01/26 (January, 26).**\r\n\r\n### Instructions for submitting projects\r\n\r\n1. If you want to work with one or two colleagues, prepare a list with students' names (3 students max.); otherwise skip to step 2.\r\n2. Pick one project, and relevant files on [GitHub](https://github.com/cogmaster-stats/r-cogstats/tree/master/projects) (or directly from this page, see below). For each project, there is a brief description of the data set and how to load data in R or Python, and a list of questions specific to that data set. \r\n3. Send an email to ch[dot]lalanne[at]gmail[dot]com with (a) your name, and the list of your coworkers if you're not working on the project alone, (b) the project you choose, and (c) the software you will be using.\r\n4. Work on the project and try to address all questions using Python or R. Only one language is allowed for the whole project. Write your answer using one of the custom templates ([R Markdown](https://github.com/cogmaster-stats/r-cogstats/blob/master/projects/template.Rmd) or [Pweave](https://github.com/cogmaster-stats/r-cogstats/blob/master/projects/template.Pnw)) that are available on GitHub. We don't need the output, just the *.Rmd or *.Pnw file. However, you will have to test your final report in order to ensure that results (Tables and Figures) are correctly printed in the HTML output file.\r\n5. Submit your work by email to ch[dot]lalanne[at]gmail[dot]com before the deadline. \r\n\r\nIn any case, you will be assessed on the quality of your report, the accuracy of the results and of your responses. We expect *correct and reproducible R or Python code*, nothing more. If are unable to report your code and results in the provided template, consider sending a simple text file with R/Python commands and plain text comments to address the questions.\r\n\r\n### Available projects\r\n\r\n1.

Regarding the project, the following rules were used for grading: 2 points for reproducible code, 6 points for answers to specific questions, 2 points for clarity and quality of writing. Basically, it was expected that the source file could be compiled without trouble (beside updating relative path to access the data file), that each question has been answered precisely using working R or Python code. A bonus mark was given for good-looking report with appropriate interpretation of the data and statistical results. Final marks were rounded up to the next integer.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## <a id=\"setup\"></a>Setup\r\n\r\n### R setup\r\n\r\nYou should already have R and RStudio. If they are not installed on your\r\nsystem, please follow these instructions:\r\n\r\n1. Go to <http://cran.r-project.org/bin/> and select a binary package for\r\n   your system. \r\n2. Go to <http://www.rstudio.com/ide/download> and download RStudio\r\n   Desktop. There is often a\r\n   [Preview Release](http://www.rstudio.com/ide/download/preview) that\r\n   include additional functionalities but is still considered in beta\r\n   stage. \r\n\r\nInstall both software as is usually done on your system. At this point, you\r\nmay want to test that everything is ok: Launch RStudio and check that the R\r\nprompt is available in the *Console* panel (it is usually sitting on the\r\nright). You can further check that R is working as expected by typing\r\n(without the prompt sign, `>`)\r\n\r\n    > 1/3 == 0.3\r\n\r\nat the R prompt. Don't worry if the result (`FALSE`) doesn't match your\r\nexpectation, we will learn why later.\r\n\r\nYou can customize RStudio layout under File ▹ Preferences. At some point, we will make use of the\r\n[R Markdown](http://www.rstudio.com/ide/docs/authoring/using_markdown)\r\nlanguage to document our working sessions. You don't need to install\r\nanything other than RStudio, but you may want to install\r\n[Pandoc](http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/), which is a tool for converting\r\namong markup formats and generate HTML or PDF documents based on a Markdown\r\nfile. As an alternative to RStudio built-in facilities, you can install an\r\nenhanced Markdwon processor:\r\n[MultiMarkdown](http://fletcherpenney.net/multimarkdown/). \r\n\r\n### Pick up a good editor\r\n\r\nSometimes, it is easier to work directly from a text editor. There are\r\nseveral good editors available for free and working on all platforms\r\n(Windows, Un*x, and OS X), including these ones:\r\n\r\n* [Emacs](http://www.gnu.org/s/emacs/); the\r\n  [ESS mode](http://ess.r-project.org/) provides everything you need to\r\n  interact with R.\r\n* [Vim](http://vim.org/); the\r\n  [Vim-R-plugin](http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=2628)\r\n  offers allows communicating with an R process directly.\r\n* [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com/2) 2 or 3 (free for evaluation purpose,\r\n  $70 for continued use); syntax highlighting for R is already available,\r\n  and the [SublimeREPL](http://sublimerepl.readthedocs.org/en/latest/)\r\n  package also allows communicating with an R process.\r\n\r\n### Git\r\n\r\nIf you want to experiment with [Git](http://git-scm.com/) and if it is not already installed on your system, go\r\ndownload the latest version of Git. When installation is completed, check\r\nthat it is available on your system by typing (again, without the prompt\r\nsign, `$`)\r\n\r\n    $ git --version\r\n\r\nin a Terminal. Windows users may have to use a specific GUI.\r\n\r\nYou can request an [educational account](https://github.com/edu) on\r\nGithub. This will allow you to create private repositories that you can use\r\nfor your course work. Or you can create an account on\r\n[BitBucket](https://bitbucket.org/), which offers unlimited private\r\nrepositories for personal use.\r\n\r\nIn any case, you can follow the course and download the latest archive of\r\nthe course on [Github](https://github.com/cogmaster-stats).\r\n\r\n\r\n### Useful readings\r\n\r\n* Kieran Healy\r\n  (2010).
